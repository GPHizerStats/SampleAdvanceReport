### 2023 Sample Advance Report
###### *2023 National Championship: Georgia vs. TCU*

This document serves as a quick example of some my capabilities in creating an analytics-driven Advance Scouting report. I chose a neutral game that everyone should be familiar with for this report, the 2023 CFP championship between Georgia and TCU. The report is being done from the perspective of Georgia as they look ahead towards TCU.

All the data from this report came from available PFF play feed data, and was analyzed in R. Additional context regarding snap counts and other stats were also pulled from PFF.
